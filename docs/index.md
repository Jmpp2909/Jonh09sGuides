Welcome to Jonh09's Guides

## Who am I

Howdy, my name is Jonh09, i've been part of the AllTheMods community for a while. Im all about learning new things, and also helping people.
<br>I've been a newbie, like you are/were, so my objective is to try to help as many people as I can, and learn along the way.

### What's this

Inspired by the [AllTheGuides](https://allthemods.github.io/alltheguides/) page (Official guides page for AllTheMods), i've had the idea to make a page where I would share my small guides/tutorials or just my way of doing something.
This page consists of pretty much all the small guides / setups i've made and stuff I taught.
Do note that none of these may be the most excellent and outstanding setups possible, it's just my take/view on how to do it.

If you find any errors or have any suggestions, you can :
    * find me in the [AllTheMods Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods) @Jonh09, 
    * or ask on this project's Github -> [Guide discussions](https://github.com/Jmpp2909/Jonh09sGuides/discussions/1).
