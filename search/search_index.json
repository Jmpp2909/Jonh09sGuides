Im all about learning new things, and also helping people. I've been a newbie, like you are/were, so my objective is to try to help as many people as I can, and learn along the way.</p>"},{"location":"#whats-this","title":"What's this","text":"<p>Inspired by the AllTheGuides page (Official guides page for AllTheMods), i've had the idea to make a page where I would share my small guides/tutorials or just my way of doing something. This page consists of pretty much all the small guides / setups i've made and stuff I taught. Do note that none of these may be the most excellent and outstanding setups possible, it's just my take/view on how to do it.</p> <p>If you find any errors or have any suggestions, you can :     * find me in the AllTheMods Discord @Jonh09,      * or ask on this project's Github -&gt; Guide discussions.</p>"}]}
